				<h4>Turn Off Electricity To Light Switch</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Flip breaker that controls light switch.</li>
					<li>Touch voltage detector to live wire to confirm it works.</li>
					<li>Confirm no electricty around light switch cover with voltage detector.</li>
				</ol>

				<h4>Remove Light Switch From Wall</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Unscrew and remove light switch cover.</li>
					<li>Confirm no electricty in wires around the light switch with voltage detector.</li>
					<li>Unscrew and remove light switch from wall.</li>
					<li>Unscrew and remove wires from light switch (so you can fully remove light switch from wall).</li>
          <li>Remember (or write down) which wire connected to which light switch connector screw so you can reconnect properly later.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h4>Check Light Switch Continuity</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Set voltage meter to continuity testing setting.</li>
          <li>Touch the voltage meter probes together to confirm it reads near 0 resistance.</li>
          <li>Turn light switch on.</li>
          <li>Touch the voltage meter probes to the light switch screws (that wires were connected to). Near 0 resistance confirms light switch works when on.</li>
          <li>If this does not work, you may need to buy a new light switch (but first try cleaning the light switch connection screws as in the "Clean Wall Wires" section below).</li>
          <li>Othwerise, turn the light switch off. Confirm that voltage meter now reads open circuit.</li>
          <li>If the light swith passes this test, then the light switch is not the problem.</li>
				</ol>

        <h4>Check Wall Wires Are Electrified</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Make sure that the wires in the wall where the light switch was removed are separated (so they do not close a circuit on the next step).</li>
          <li>Flip breaker back on.</li>
          <li>Touch voltage detector to the wires in the wall. Confirm if electricity is reaching this point.</li>
          <li>Flip breaker back off!</li>
          <li>If there was no electricty in the wires, reconnect the light switch (to avoid lose wires) and call an electrician.</li>
          <li>Otherwise, there may be an issue with the electricity conducting from the wall wires to the light switch.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Clean Wall Wires</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Inspect the wires, if they look dirty or blackened they may need to be cleaned.</li>
          <li>Prepare two mixtures: white vinegar with a little salt (for grittiness) and water with some baking soda (to neutralize vinegar).</li>
          <li>Submerge wires in vinegar mixture (or wipe with mixture if submerging not practical).</li>
          <li>Wait a few minutes (reapply often if you are only able to wipe vinegar mixture on).</li>
          <li>Scrub/wipe the vinegar off the wires.</li>
          <li>Submerge/wipe the baking soda mixture on the wires to neutralize the acid in the vinegar</li>
          <li>Dry the wires.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Reconnect Light Switch</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Connect the wires back to the light switch connector screw (as they were originally).</li>
          <li>Screw the light switch back into the wall.</li>
          <li>Screw the light switch cover back into the wall.</li>
          <li>Flip breaker back on.</li>
          <li>Does the light switch work now?</li>
          <li>If not call an electrician.</li>
        </ol>
