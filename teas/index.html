            <p><del><em>Colonial Bohea (3 mins @ 195&deg;F)</em>: slightly smokey black tea (most popular imported tea in colonial America).</del> I am working through which types of teas I prefer here. In the 1600s, the term "tea" meant green tea. The processes for oxidizing tea had not been developed. The first oxidized teas were created in the Wuyi Mountains in China (we would now call these black and oolong teas). Europe and colonial America imported these oxidized teas and referred to them as "bohea" (pronounced "boo-hee", an English-ification of the pronunciation of "Wuyi"). As oxidized teas gained popularity in the 1700s, the higher quality leaves were given names (Lapsang Souchong, Pekoe, etc) and the term "bohea" was used for lower quality oxidized tea. So "Colonial Bohea" is not actually a type of tea - it is a specific blend of black and oolong teas sold by Oliver Pluff & Co. </p>
